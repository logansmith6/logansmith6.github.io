 This project was a lot of fun. I felt behind going into it, but I quickly became absorbed in both learning and mastering the concepts. Being able to use the shotgun gem made it 100 times easier; testing and refreshing the page to see the changes makes a huge difference. Once I had all the gems I needed and had all the files talking to each other in the correct way, it felt as easy as doing a long lab. 
     
    I was a lot better about committing my work often, which helped a lot when I needed to backtrack. Other than a few issues that lasted several hours, mostly simple things like forgetting an end in a random place, I did not have a lot of trouble with this project. I am excited for my review!
