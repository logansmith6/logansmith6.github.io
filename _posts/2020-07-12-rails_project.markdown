I felt inspired by the topic of my project and think this is why creating it went by so fast for me. I liked the idea of an instagram-style catalogue for famous paintings so I ran with it. I had some issues, for sure I did, like getting nested forms to save user inputed data to class attributes outside of the object scope (I hope I described that properly). Anyway, it feels good to be finished with my rails project (mk1?) I feel ready for my review but I would not be surprised if my project is lacking in one element or another. Either way, I definitely learned a lot and am eager to get some feedback.
