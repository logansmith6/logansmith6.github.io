Today's blog will cover my latest  project in the Flatiron Curriculum. My project, named Art Catalogue, was built using the Ruby on Rails framework and I constructed it using a variety of Rails concepts. Moving on from my Sinatra project, I could see that Sinatra and Rails are comparable in a lot of ways. After I finished my Sinatra project and began working with rails, I saw that we would still be using routes, mvc, and activerecord. This made me wonder if there was any reason to use Rails instead of Sinatra. However, as I continued to work through the Rails material, it became clear to me that if Sinatra was a screwdriver, then Rails would be a toolshed. Rails may be more complicated, but this complexity can be used to create compex web applications.


**Art Catalogue - Brainstorming**
The idea for my project was easy to find. My grandfather was an artist and after he passed, my family was left with a huge collection of paintings. My parents have since decorated their house with his work, but I have given them mutiple reminders to make digital copies of each painting, for safekeeping. Recently, I reminded them of this again and an idea came to me:  an online application that can be used to digitize artwork! Essentialy, it could be an online photo vault for paintings. After more pondering, I decided that it would be interesting to add different elements of social media to my app.

With these models, I was finally able to see my application's potential. A user would sign in, browse and like paintings, and then post one of their own. 

**Problems**
The first major hiccup in the deisgn of my project was figuring out a way to properly associate artists with their paintings. At the same time, I needed to prevent new instances of an artist from being created if they were already in the database. So, naturally, when I discovered the *find_or_create_by* function, it was love at first sight. For those that are unfamiliar with rails functions, find or create by is used to locate instances of a class by a given criteria. If there is no such instance, then a new one is created.

**Conclusion**
After overcoming several mountains, I was pleased to report that I had finished my project. I enjoyed practicing the ways of Ruby on Rails and learned a lot  about problem solving. My first two projects required a lot less critical thinking and time management, but this effort was not in vain. I had a vision of what my project could be and I worked towards it, compartmentalizing different tasks ahead of me. If it were not for frequently committing my work, the entire process would have felt like a singular thought. This idea of a "singular thought" demonstrates the potential of truly understanding a coding language: being able to turn any idea into a product. I do not claim to be fluent, yet, but I started with a metaphorical blank canvas and now sit with a completed product.
