Today's blog will cover my latest  project in the Flatiron Curriculum. My project, named Board, was built with Javascript utilizing a Rails API. It is a simple game inspired by checkers (with less rules). Users can only move diagonally but can move forwards or backwards alike. My original plan was to have online capability, but late into the project I cam to the realization that this would be outside of my current skill. I do, however, plan to update the game to support online player vs. player. 
		 I chose the topic of this project while I was only a couple of days into the curriculum, so I had quite some time to brainstorm.  With that being said, here is a glimpse into the production of my latest project.


      


**Board - Opportunity**
    I enjoyed checkers as a kid so I had no problem with gaining the motivation to get started on this project.  I saw a potential to create a game that'd be fun to play, so that was the goal. I was picturing my younger self and tried to reach a point in which the young me would have tried it out of interest.  
		My goals were simple: enable the ability to pick a username and play. I also wanted to track each user's games/wins, so I figured this would satisfy the has_many/ belongs_to requirement for the Rails side of things. A user will have many games, and each game belongs to a user. ![](https://i.imgur.com/x8dZG1G.pnghttp://)

**Problems**

   Problems?  Um.... Yes. All jokes aside, I considered them to be more like puzzles than problems. With Javascript, testing and debugging is so extremely convenient that it almost felt like going through the tests of a Flatiron lab. That being said, there were some "puzzles" that took up entire afternoons of my time. For instance, getting my classes to correlate based on their relationship (has many/ belongs to) was an extreme thorn in my keyboard. I spent far too much time trying stuff out in my frontend. If I had just taken a moment to think logically, "Okay, so the relationship stems from the backend, not the frontend," then I would have saved hours! All I had to do was pass the appropriate info through a patch-fetch and my user model was properly updated with it's newly associated game. After that time, though, undoing the major amount of changes that I made as an attempt to solve my initial problem turned out to be a problem of its own. But hey, it wouldn't be a true coding experience if you didn't try over a thousand incorrect remedies for a simple issue. 
 
     

   
 


**Conclusion**

   The process of building my application taught me a lot about the relationship between the frontend and backend, and I cannot wait to try some of the other APIs that I've read about. The Rails API, however, was a great starting point because of the deep understanding aquired through the previous semester. Now that I have finished this project, I am overly excited to get my hands on some new material.  I am proud of my work and excited for the feedback that will come very soon. I am sure that there are certain elements within my project that could be improved and it will be very constructive for it to reach a new set of eyes.
